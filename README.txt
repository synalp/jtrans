In order to use jtrans, you need to download the full compiled package: jtrans2full.tgz
You can then execute the file dist/jtrans.jar, and test JTrans by loading the wav file "culture.wav" and
the text file "culture.txt". Then, press the "Play" button to check that the audio playback is
working; press the same button again to stop audio playback. Then, use menu "edit / parse text standard"
to analyze the text (you should see punctuation marks highlighted in orange).
Then, press the "AutoAlign" button to start automatic alignement. After a few seconds, the aligned text gets
underlined and you can press the "Play" button again to start playback in "karaoke" mode.

In order to start developping/adapting jtrans, you further need to download the latest source code,
available under GIT on my website.
